## File Formats

### Keypair JSON Format

```json
{
  "secret_key": "hex-encoded-64-byte-secret-key",
  "public_key": "hex-encoded-32-byte-public-key"
}
```

### Chain JSON Format

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "index": 0,
      "timestamp": 0,
      "ops": [{"Put": {"key": "__genesis__", "value": "ok"}}],
      "prev_hash": "0",
      "merkle_root": "GENESIS",
      "nonce": 0,

## Security Features

### Cryptographic Security
- **Ed25519 Signatures**: Industry-standard elliptic curve signatures
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Secure cryptographic hash function
- **Merkle Tree Verification**: Efficient operation integrity checking
- **Proof-of-Work**: Computational difficulty prevents spam

### Key Management Security
- **Secure Key Generation**: Uses OS random number generator
- **Key Persistence**: Safely store and load keypairs
- **Public Key Verification**: Validate signatures against stored public keys
- **Genesis Block Exception**: Only genesis block lacks signature requirement

### Chain Integrity
- **Hash Chain Linking**: Each block references previous block hash
- **Complete Verification**: Validates entire chain on load
- **Operation Ordering**: Maintains chronological operation sequence
- **State Consistency**: Materializes consistent state from operation history

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Difficulty

Adjust mining difficulty for different security/performance trade-offs:

```bash
chain-kv> difficulty 5  # Requires 5 leading zeros (much harder)
```

### Batch Operations

While this version doesn't support batching, you can quickly execute multiple operations:

```bash
chain-kv> set user1 Alice
chain-kv> set user2 Bob
chain-kv> set user3 Charlie
```

### Chain Analysis

Use the verification system to analyze chain properties:

```bash
chain-kv> verify
‚úÖ chain ok (4 blocks, difficulty 3)

chain-kv> state
user1 = Alice
user2 = Bob
user3 = Charlie
```

## Development

### Testing

```bash
cargo test
```

### Building for Production

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Debugging

The application provides detailed error messages and mining progress:

```bash
‚ùå no signing key loaded. Use: loadkey <file>
‚ùå verify failed: signature verify failed
‚õèÔ∏è  mining‚Ä¶ nonce=45123       rate=3421 H/s last=0001a2b3
```

## Migration from rust-01

This version extends the basic blockchain with:
- Interactive CLI instead of hardcoded operations
- Persistent key management
- Chain save/load functionality
- Real-time mining progress
- Enhanced error handling
- State querying capabilities

## Next Steps

For even more advanced features, see:
- `rust-03/chain_kv_full`: Adds HTTP API server, batching, and web interface

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"no signing key loaded"**: Generate and load a keypair first
2. **"verify failed"**: Chain integrity compromised, check file corruption
3. **"bad signature hex"**: Keypair file may be corrupted
4. **Mining too slow**: Reduce difficulty level

### Performance Tips

- Lower difficulty for faster mining during development
- Use SSD storage for better I/O performance
- Monitor system resources during intensive mining
