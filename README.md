## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Start with Basics (Recommended)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rjaysolamo/blockchain-learn.git
cd blockchain-learn

# Start with the foundation
cd rust-01/chain_kv
cargo run
```

### Option 2: Jump to CLI Version
```bash
cd rust-02/chain_kv_pow_sig_merkle
cargo run -- --help
```

### Option 3: Try the Full API Server
```bash
cd rust-03/chain_kv_full
cargo run -- server --port 3000
```

## 📚 Learning Path

### 🎓 Beginner (rust-01)
1. **Understand the code structure** in `src/main.rs`
2. **Run the basic example** with `cargo run`
3. **Experiment with difficulty** by modifying the PoW difficulty
4. **Study the verification process** and security features

### 🎓 Intermediate (rust-02)
1. **Explore CLI commands** with `cargo run -- --help`
2. **Generate and manage keys** with key commands
3. **Create and persist chains** using file operations
4. **Understand state materialization** and data persistence

### 🎓 Advanced (rust-03)
1. **Start the API server** and explore HTTP endpoints
2. **Implement batch transactions** for efficiency
3. **Study async mining** and concurrent operations
4. **Deploy and scale** the blockchain system

## 🔧 Key Technologies

- **Rust**: Systems programming language for performance and safety
- **SHA-256**: Cryptographic hashing for block integrity
- **Ed25519**: Digital signature algorithm for authentication
- **Merkle Trees**: Efficient transaction verification
- **Proof-of-Work**: Consensus mechanism for decentralization
- **Axum**: Modern async web framework for APIs
- **Serde**: Serialization framework for data persistence

## 🏗️ Architecture Concepts

### Core Components
- **Block Structure**: Index, timestamp, operations, hashes, signatures
- **Chain Management**: Linked blocks with cryptographic verification
- **Operation Types**: Put (insert/update) and Del (delete) operations
- **Mining Process**: Proof-of-Work with adjustable difficulty
- **Signature Verification**: Ed25519 for block authenticity

### Security Features
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: SHA-256 for tamper detection
- **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 for non-repudiation
- **Chain Integrity**: Previous block hash linking
- **Proof-of-Work**: Computational cost for consensus
- **Merkle Root**: Efficient transaction verification

## 🔒 Security Considerations
